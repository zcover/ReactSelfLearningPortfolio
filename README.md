# ReactSelfLearningPortfolio

## Praise to Code Fellows!
I will be practicing and learning from the Code Fellows 401 JavaScript Repo, which can be found publicly at:

`https://github.com/codefellows/code-401-JS-prework`

## Who
My Name is Zerek Cover, and I am a young software engineer in learning.

I hope to start my career soon, and know that ReactJs is huge in the workplace, so this repo serves to keep track of my learning pace, and display my current level of understanding as I pursue the furthering of education in an ever-progressing field of Software Development.

* ## Purpose
    * Having started, but not completing a coding boot-camp, I have become extremely interested in becoming a software developer.

    * Since my limiting factor was financial stabilization, I have begun to self-teach where my learning was cut-short.

    * My goal for this Repository is to keep notes and practical examples of techniques or particular functions. 



* ## Track
    * I want to track my progress with visible code-challenges and applied theories, create projects which display my current level of understanding.

# Thank you
I hope to have ReactJs learned, and be progressing my understanding through experimentation, rather than
